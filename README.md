## Documentation

### Part: i

We began our project by importing the necessary Libraries for statrting our project.

`import Pandas as pd`

`import numpy as np`

As we are interested in the finding the sentiment score of the reviews of each restaurant,we started with the cleaning of the reviews.

We used `ast.literal_eval`method from `ast`: Abstract Syntax Trees library to convert the strings to a list of tuples to extract the needed information.

After converting the strings to list of tuples, we cleaned out the characters that are unnecessary and  might affect the accuracy of the sentiment score towards the end.

Further, we used `re` library to further clean the data like Removing Non ALphabets, Non English Words and to convert all Upper Cases to Lowere Cases.


 For the final part of the cleaning, we put the reviews through NLTK pipeline of: 
 
`Text_Cleaning` â†’ `Stopwords`  â†’ `Lemmetization`.


 After getting the Cleaned Text(reviews in this case), we pass it through our Sentiment Analyzer.

 For that, we are using  `blob.sentiment.polarity` from the `TextBlob` library. After getting the sentiment scores, we merge the score column with our Dataset for further use.
