## Documentation
### Packages Used


### Part: i
Our Project began with EDA and some basic cleaning of our dataset to have a better understanding of it and to make it better to work with.







After EDA, we moved to Sentiment Analysis of our reviews list. To apply Sentiment Analysis, we must pass our reviews through a pipeline (`Tokenization` â†’ `Text_Cleaning` â†’ `Stopwords`  â†’ `Lemmetization`) which cleans the data making it fit for Sentiment Analysis.

For Sentiment Analysis, we are using  `blob.sentiment.polarity` from the `TextBlob` library. After getting the sentiment scores, we merge the score column with our Dataset for further use.

### Part: ii

After the sentiment scores for each restaurant is obtained, we move on to our objective i.e. to recomend restaurant based using Sentiment Analysis. As our dataset has other important features like Average Rating and no. of votes, we made a metric which take equal weightage from the mentioned features and calculate a score. This score is used to rank the restaurant.
